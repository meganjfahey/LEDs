# Decoration ideas:


## Repurpose existing ping pong ball LED strings 
* Get the lights from friend
* See what the state of the controls are
* Set up new controls, with NodeMCU and FastLED, Arduino or Adafruit libraries

**What would this be used as?**
* Photo wall?
* Sitting with plants on table?
* Clustered on floor (if circuit is safe enough)?


## Use existing LED strips
* Connect them into long strips
* Program/control with NodeMCU, or with other controller
* FastLED library
* Get help from friend

**What would they be used for?**
* Lighting hallway walls
* Lighting tables
* Behind furniture - glow from behind things
* Windowsills


## Make strings from single LEDs
* Source LEDs; from friends with unused ones, or buy
* Get something like wall art with a 12V supply from a second hand store
* Use soldering equipment at campus
* Do the string in parallel, or in units containing parallel lights, to meet power supply constraints
* Find out if need resistors for this
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kQADYm6ivY - building a string circuit

**What would they be used for?**
* Putting in jars
* Making my own wall art shapes/configurations
* Stringing with plants and flowers


## Buy copper strings
* If it becomes too impractical to make my own strings, then buy simple ones from Kmart, The Warehouse, or LightInTheBox NZ

**What would they be used for?**
* Putting in jars
* Making my own wall art shapes/configurations
* Stringing with plants and flowers
