# LED string

## LEDs in parallel

## Power supply

**Could be taken from an existing light object**
* Would need to buy a second-hand object
* Take apart and repurpose

*Pros:*
* The supply would already be purpose built for powering a light
* Cheap(ish)

*Cons:*
* May be low Amps

**Strip a USB and integrate the wires into a circuit**
* Buy new and cheap or find an old surplus one

*Pros*
* May be easier to find and deal with than a supply

*Cons*
* Would need a wall adapter for every string
* May be expensive
* Might be harder to insulate, as USB cables are not built to be stripped

## Soldering

**Will take a long time**

**Could come loose and break the circuit, therefore circuit may not be very flexible**

## Insulation

**Would have to source insulation materials**
**May still not be suitable for use on some materials such as fabric and plants**
